Web phishing detection refers to the process of identifying and preventing phishing attacks on websites. Phishing attacks involve fraudulent attempts to obtain sensitive information, such as usernames, passwords, and financial details, by impersonating trustworthy entities through emails, websites, or other digital communication channels.

**Objective of the System**   
The objective of a web phishing detection system is to effectively identify and mitigate phishing      attacks on web platforms to safeguard users and organizations against the risks associated with fraudulent activities. Here are the primary objectives of such a system:
⦁	Detect Phishing Attacks: The primary objective is to detect phishing attacks in real-time or near-real-time as they occur on web platforms. This includes identifying phishing websites, deceptive emails, fake login pages, and other malicious content designed to trick users into divulging sensitive information.
⦁	Prevent Unauthorized Access: The system aims to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information by proactively blocking users from interacting with phishing websites and malicious content. This helps mitigate the risk of data breaches, identity theft, and financial fraud associated with phishing attacks.

**Scope of the System**
The scope of a web phishing detection system encompasses various aspects related to the identification, prevention, and mitigation of phishing attacks on web platforms. Here are the key components within the scope of such a system:
⦁	Phishing Detection Algorithms: The system includes algorithms and techniques for detecting phishing attempts, such as analyzing URLs, web page content, email headers, and user behavior to identify indicators of phishing.
⦁	Real-time Monitoring: The system continuously monitors web traffic and user interactions in real-time to detect and respond to phishing attacks as they occur.
⦁	URL and Content Analysis: It analyzes URLs and web page content to identify characteristics commonly associated with phishing, such as suspicious domain names, misleading forms, unauthorized redirections, and malicious scripts.
⦁	Blacklist and Whitelist Management: The system maintains blacklists of known phishing websites and whitelists of trusted domains to aid in the identification and blocking of malicious content.

**Fact Finding Techniques**
Fact-finding techniques play a crucial role in detecting phishing websites. Phishing websites aim to deceive users into divulging sensitive information such as passwords, credit card numbers, or personal details. Here are some fact-finding techniques commonly used to detect phishing websites:

**URL Inspection:**
⦁	Analyze the URL carefully for misspellings or slight variations of legitimate domain names.
⦁	Look for HTTPS encryption. Legitimate websites usually have HTTPS encryption for secure data transfer.
⦁	Check for suspicious subdomains or long, complex URLs that try to mimic legitimate sites.

**Domain Reputation Checking:**
⦁	Use domain reputation services or tools to check the reputation of the domain. There are several online services available that provide reputation scores for domains.
⦁	Look for recent domain registrations. Phishing websites often use newly registered domains to evade detection.
